This **random sentence generator** is made to construct funny and interesting sentences.

## Solution

The generator is based on the following model:

* [sentence] = `Who` + `action` + `details`
   *  **Who** = `name` from `place`
   *  Names = [Daniel, Martin, John, Steven, Victor]
   *  Places = [New York, Paris, Plovdiv, Rome, Sofia]
* Action = `verbs` + `noun` + `adverbs` 
   * Verbs = [eats, hold, drinks, sees, brings]
   * Nouns = [stones, cake, apple, carrot, laptop]
   * Adverbs = [slowly, rapidly, sadly, warmly, carefuly]
* Details = [near the river, in the park, at home, in the pool]
